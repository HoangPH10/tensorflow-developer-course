to be using a special kind of neural network called a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**.\n","\n","The premise of an RNN is simple: use information from the past to help you with the future (this is where the term recurrent comes from). In other words, take an input (`X`) and compute an output (`y`) based on all previous inputs.\n","\n","This concept is especially helpful when dealing with sequences such as passages of natural language text (such as our Tweets).\n","\n","For example, when you read this sentence, you take into context the previous words when deciphering the meaning of the current word dog. \n","\n","See what happened there? \n","\n","I put the word \"dog\" at the end which is a valid word but it doesn't make sense in the context of the rest of the sentence.\n","\n","When an RNN looks at a sequence of text (already in numerical form), the patterns it learns are continually updated based on the order of the sequence. \n","\n","For a simple example, take two sentences:\n","1. Massive earthquake last week, no?\n","2. No massive earthquake last week.\n","\n","Both contain exactly the same words but have different meaning. The order of the words determines the meaning (one could argue punctuation marks also dictate the meaning but for simplicity sake, let's stay focused on the words).\n","\n","Recurrent neural networks can be used for a number of sequence-based problems:\n","* **One to one:** one input, one output, such as image classification.\n","* **One to many:** one input, many outputs, such as image captioning (image input, a sequence of text as caption output).\n","* **Many to one:** many inputs, one outputs, such as text classification (classifying a Tweet as real diaster or not real diaster).\n","* **Many to many:** many inputs, many outputs, such as machine translation (translating English to Spanish) or speech to text (audio wave as input, text as output).\n","\n","When you come across RNN's in the wild, you'll most likely come across variants of the following:\n","* Long short-term memory cells (LSTMs).\n","* Gated recurrent units (GRUs).\n","* Bidirectional RNN's (passes forward and backward along a sequence, left to right and right to left).\n","\n","Going into the details of each these is beyond the scope of this notebook (we're going to focus on using them instead), the main thing you should know for now is that they've proven very effective at modelling sequences.\n","\n","For a deeper understanding of what's happening behind the scenes of the code we're about to write, I'd recommend the following resources:\n","\n","> 📖 **Resources:**\n","> * [MIT Deep Learning Lecture on Recurrent Neural Networks](https://youtu.be/SEnXr6v2ifU) - explains the background of recurrent

So a common term you'll come across in NLP problems is called *seq2seq*, in other words, finding information in one sequence to produce another sequence (e.g. converting a speech command to a sequence of text-based steps).\n","\n","To get hands-on with NLP in TensorFlow, we're going to practice the steps we've used previously but this time with text data:\n","\n","```\n","Text -> turn into numbers -> build a model -> train the model to find patterns -> use patterns (make predictions)\n","```\n","\n","> 📖 **Resource:** For a great overview of NLP and the different problems within it, read the article [*A Simple Introduction to Natural Language Processing*](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32).\n","\n","## What we're going to cover\n","\n","Let's get specific hey?\n","\n","* Downloading a text dataset\n","* Visualizing text data\n","* Converting text into numbers using tokenization\n","* Turning our tokenized text into an embedding\n","* Modelling a text dataset\n","  * Starting with a baseline (TF-IDF)\n","  * Building several deep learning text models\n","    * Dense, LSTM, GRU, Conv1D, Transfer learning\n","* Comparing the performance of each our models\n","* Combining our models into an ensemble\n","* Saving and loading a trained model\n","* Find the most wrong predictions\n","\n","## How you should approach this notebook\n","\n","You can read through the descriptions and the code (it should all run, except for the cells which error on purpose), but there's a better option.\n","\n","Write all of the code yourself.\n","\n","Yes. I'm serious. Create a new notebook, and rewrite each line by yourself.

A machine learning algorithm requires its inputs to be in numerical form.\n","\n","In NLP, there are two main concepts for turning text into numbers:\n","* **Tokenization** - A straight mapping from word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n","  1. Using **word-level tokenization** with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being `0`, \"love\" being `1` and \"TensorFlow\" being `2`. In this case, every word in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n","  2. **Character-level tokenization**, such as converting the letters A-Z to values `1-26`. In this case, every character in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n","  3. **Sub-word tokenization** is in between word-level and character-level tokenization. It involves breaking invidual words into smaller parts and then converting those smaller parts into numbers. For example, \"my favourite food is pineapple pizza\" might become \"my, fav, avour, rite, fo, oo, od, is, pin, ine, app, le, piz, za\". After doing this, these sub-words would then be mapped to a numerical value. In this case, every word could be considered multiple **tokens**.\n","* **Embeddings** - An embedding is a representation of natural language which can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a **feature vector**. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector `[-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]`. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings: \n","  1. **Create your own embedding** - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as [`tf.keras.layers.Embedding`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding)) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n","  2. **Reuse a pre-learned embedding** - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpuses of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a pre-trained embedding to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your own specific task.\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/08-tokenization-vs-embedding.png)\n","*Example of **tokenization** (straight mapping from word to number) and **embedding** (richer representation of relationships between tokens).*\n","\n","> 🤔 **Question:** What level of tokenzation should I use? What embedding should should I choose?\n","\n","It depends on your problem. You could try character-level tokenization/embeddings and word-level tokenization/embeddings and see which perform best. You might even want to try stacking them (e.g. combining the outputs of your embedding layers using [`tf.keras.layers.concatenate`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/concatenate)). \n","\n","If you're looking for pre-trained word embeddings, [Word2vec embeddings](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/), [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and many of the options available on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-embedding) are great places to start.\n","\n","> 🔑 **Note:** Much like searching for a pre-trained computer vision model, you can search for pre-trained word embeddings to use for your problem.

Default is `\"lower_and_strip_punctuation\"` which lowers text and removes all punctuation marks.\n","* `split` - How to split text, default is `\"whitespace\"` which splits on spaces.\n","* `ngrams` - How many words to contain per token split, for example, `ngrams=2` splits tokens into continuous sequences of 2.\n","* `output_mode` -  How to output tokens, can be `\"int\"` (integer mapping), `\"binary\"` (one-hot encoding), `\"count\"` or `\"tf-idf\"`. See documentation for more.\n","* `output_sequence_length` - Length of tokenized sequence to output. For example, if `output_sequence_length=150`, all tokenized sequences will be 150 tokens long.\n","* `pad_to_max_tokens` - Defaults to `False`, if `True`, the output feature axis will be padded to `max_tokens` even if the number of unique tokens in the vocabulary is less than `max_tokens`.

However, this is a TensorFlow specific standard. If you need a more general-purpose data standard, `HDF5` might be better. For more, check out the [TensorFlow documentation on saving and loading models](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load).\n","## Finding the most wrong examples\n","\n","We mentioned before that if many of our modelling experiments are returning similar results, despite using different kinds of models, it's a good idea to return to the data and inspect why this might be.\n","\n","One of the best ways to inspect your data is to sort your model's predictions and find the samples it got *most* wrong, meaning, what predictions had a high prediction probability but turned out to be wrong.\n","\n","Once again, visualization is your friend.
